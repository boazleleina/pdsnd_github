### Project Title
EXPLORE US BIKESHARE DATA

### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
I used data from three cities in form of csv files, including:
1. chicago.csv
2. new_york_city.csv
3. washington.csv

### Credits
All data were provided by Udacity towards the completion of the Programming for Data Science NanoDegree.
